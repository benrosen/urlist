# `src/ui/`

This directory contains the React components that comprise the user interface.

Design of the user interface is [component driven](https://www.componentdriven.org/). Components are designed and organized according to the [atomic design methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) serves as the project's foundational component library.

To start the component playground and documentation site locally, use:

```
npm run storybook
```

For more information about the `storybook` command, [read their docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction).
